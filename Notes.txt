Maven is a popular build automation and project management tool primarily used for Java projects. Let me explain its key aspects and benefits:
Maven solves several core problems in software development:

Dependency Management: Maven automatically downloads and manages project dependencies (external libraries) through its pom.xml configuration file. Instead of manually downloading JARs, you just declare what you need:

    xmlCopy<dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-core</artifactId>
        <version>5.3.20</version>
    </dependency>

Build Process: Maven provides a standardized way to build, test and package applications using a concept called "lifecycle." Key phases include:

compile: compiles source code
test: runs unit tests
package: creates JAR/WAR files
install: installs the package in local repository
deploy: copies the package to remote repository


Project Structure: Maven enforces a standard project structure:

Copysrc/main/java        # Application source code
src/main/resources   # Configuration files
src/test/java        # Test source code
src/test/resources   # Test resources
target/              # Compiled output
pom.xml             # Project configuration

Convention over Configuration: Maven follows the "convention over configuration" principle - it provides sensible defaults for project layout, build process, and dependency management, reducing the need for explicit configuration.

The main benefits of using Maven include:

Consistent build process across different machines and environments
Centralized dependency management
Rich ecosystem of plugins for various tasks (code quality, documentation, deployment)
Integration with major IDEs like Eclipse and IntelliJ
Built-in support for generating project documentation and reports

I'll create a mix of basic to advanced Maven interview questions that you might encounter, along with suggested answers.

Here are some commonly asked Maven interview questions:

Basic Level:
1. "What is the difference between Maven and Ant?"
   Answer: Maven is declarative and uses conventions (pom.xml), while Ant is procedural and requires explicit scripting. Maven has built-in dependency management, while Ant requires manual dependency handling.

2. "What is the significance of pom.xml?"
   Answer: POM (Project Object Model) is Maven's core configuration file that contains project information, dependencies, build settings, and plugins. It's where you define how your project should be built.

Intermediate Level:
3. "Explain Maven's build lifecycle phases."
   Answer: Key phases include:
   - validate: Validates project structure
   - compile: Compiles source code
   - test: Runs tests
   - package: Creates JAR/WAR
   - install: Installs to local repository
   - deploy: Deploys to remote repository

4. "What is the difference between Maven's SNAPSHOT and RELEASE versions?"
   Answer: SNAPSHOT is for development versions that can change, while RELEASE versions are immutable and final. For example, 1.0-SNAPSHOT might be updated daily, but 1.0-RELEASE never changes.

Advanced Level:
5. "How would you handle dependency conflicts in Maven?"
   Answer: You can:
   - Use <exclusions> tag to exclude conflicting transitive dependencies
   - Specify dependency versions explicitly
   - Use dependency:tree command to analyze conflicts
   - Apply dependency mediation principles

6. "Explain Maven's dependency scopes and when to use each."
   Answer: Main scopes include:
   - compile: Default scope, available everywhere
   - provided: Available for compilation but not packaged (like servlet-api)
   - runtime: Not needed for compilation, needed for execution
   - test: Only for testing
   - system: Similar to provided but requires explicit path

Scenario-Based:
7. "You have a multi-module project where module A depends on module B. How would you structure this in Maven?"
   Answer: You'd create:
   - Parent pom with packaging type 'pom'
   - Separate pom files for each module
   - Define module relationships using <modules> and <dependencies>

Technical Questions:
8. "What's the difference between mvn clean install and mvn clean deploy?"
   Answer: install puts the artifact in local repository, while deploy puts it in both local and remote repositories. Deploy is typically used in CI/CD pipelines.

Best Practices:
9. "What are some Maven best practices you follow in your projects?"
   Answer:
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Use dependency management section for version control
   - Follow standard directory structure
   - Minimize use of SNAPSHOT dependencies in production
   - Use appropriate scopes for dependencies
